# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Cryptocurrency Prices

## Overview
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and dynamic, influenced by trends, seasonality, and external factors. Understanding historical price movements and forecasting future trends is essential for data-driven analysis.  
This project focuses on applying **data analytics and time series techniques** to cryptocurrency price data in order to extract insights, identify patterns, and forecast future prices.

---

## Problem Statement
Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate significantly over time, making it difficult for analysts and investors to understand long-term trends and short-term movements. There is a need for structured data analytics approaches that analyze historical price data, identify temporal patterns, and generate forecasts that can support informed decision-making.  
This project aims to analyze cryptocurrency price data using time series analysis, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build forecasting models to predict future price trends.
